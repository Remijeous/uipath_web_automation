Robot 3: Automation challenge

The goal of this Bot is to create a workflow that will input data from a spreadsheet into the form fields on the screen.
Beware! The fields will change position on the screen after every submission, throughout 10 rounds, thus the workflow must 
correctly identify where each spreadsheet record must be typed every time.
